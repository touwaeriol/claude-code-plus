# Sequential Thinking MCP Server Instructions

Use this server for step-by-step reasoning and complex problem solving.

**Note:** If the model already supports extended thinking (like Claude with thinking enabled), this MCP is not needed.

## Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` | Process complex problems through step-by-step reasoning |

## Usage Guidelines

1. Use for complex problems that benefit from explicit step-by-step reasoning
2. Break down problems into smaller, manageable steps
3. Each step should build on previous steps logically
4. Useful for mathematical proofs, logical deductions, and multi-step analysis
5. Not needed when the model's native extended thinking is enabled
